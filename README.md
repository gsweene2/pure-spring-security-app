# A Spring Website

Continuous development of a Spring website, integrating Spring Dependencies to improve Spring skills!

## What's currently implemented

(on master) Spring Security with simple hardcoded user/pass convos that restricts page access if not logged in

## Things I had that I'm in process of replacing

(not yet) Instead of using hardcoded user/pass, hook up to a mysql db

## Current Developments
